## What does it do? üìù

It's an app that harnesses the power of pre-trained transformers and their natural language processing capabilities to create portuguese paraphrases from any given text you have highlighted in your browser.

Why only highlighted texts? Well, we thought it would be a better UX than just throwing an input box :)

## How to use it:
1. **Highlight** any text inside your browser.
2. **Click** on the extension icon.
3. Click the **"paraphrase now"** button and wait a few seconds.

### Showcase:

### You're done!! üéâüéâ
You'll receive a list with a few paraphrases that you may use to enhance your writting experience.
Clicking on any result paraphrase will copy it's text so you can paste it anywhere you want.

> **Note**: This process assumes you already have a web server running the model, if you don't, check the installation process down below.

## Architecture and Installation

### Architecture

Our application uses a transformers language **model** and a **translation api**.
- Paraphrasing model. English To English.
  - [<ins>**Parrot**</ins>](https://huggingface.co/prithivida/parrot_paraphraser_on_T5) 
- Translation API.
  - [<ins>**Google Cloud Translation**</ins>](https://cloud.google.com/translate) 
 
At the time of writting this readme, the model is being hosted by a flask web server running in a Google Cloud VM with 4 cores and 16 GiB RAM. It's service costs around **$170** monthly not counting for the translation costs, i'm currently affording it, but it won't be up for long.

**You may host it for yourself!**
