## What does it do?

This is an app that harnesses the power of pre-trained transformers and their natural language processing capabilities to create portuguese paraphrases from any given text you have highlighted in your browser.

> **Note**: English support will be shipped in the next update.

Why only highlighted texts? Well, we thought it would be a better UX than just throwing an input box :)

## How to use it:
1. Highlight any text inside your browser.
2. Click on the extension icon.
3. Click the "paraphrase" button and wait a few seconds.

### You're done!! üéâüéâ
You'll receive a list with a few paraphrases that you may use to enhance your writting experience.
Clicking on any result paraphrase will copy it's text so you can paste it anywhere you want.

> **Note**: This process assumes you already have a web server running the model, if you don't, check the installation process down below.

## Architecture

Our application uses 3 different transformers language **models**.
- 1 for paraphrasing.
  - [<ins>**Parrot**</ins>](https://huggingface.co/prithivida/parrot_paraphraser_on_T5) 
- 2 for translation.
  - [<ins>**Narrativa mBART EN to PT**</ins>](https://huggingface.co/Narrativa/mbart-large-50-finetuned-opus-en-pt-translation) 
  - [<ins>**Narrativa mBART PT to EN**</ins>](https://huggingface.co/Narrativa/mbart-large-50-finetuned-opus-pt-en-translation)
  
At the time of writting this readme, the model is hosted in a Google Cloud VM with an NVIDIA T4 GPU that has 16gb. It's service costs around $400 so it won't be up for long.
**Unfortunately we can't host it for everyone**, for now, affording a GPU focused server is not a priority.
